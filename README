Cardiac Electrophysiology Modules

This program is designed to post-process the output of CardioSolv
LLC's CARP simulator, either in serial or in parallel. It is ideally
suited to analyzing large datasets in parallel using MPI.

The "modules" name comes from the fact that it is a library of modules
that may build on each other, and be built upon to create analysis
scripts. The main analysis techniques that people seem to want to use
are already included in the parallel_mapper and trace programs, but it
should be quick and easy to build other utilities as needed.

In general, foo_mod.cxx files implement something meant to deal with
single element data, while foo_map_mod.cxx files build on the
foo_mod.cxx files to analyze data from many elements in parallel. For
a good example, start with the act_mod.cxx and corresponding
amap_mod.cxx files. These demonstrate how to expand from a single
element to many elements.

= Build System =

Currently you should copy Makefile.example to Makefile, and then edit
Makefile appropriately for your machine. A CMake-based build system is
in the works.

Then type "make parallel_mapper", or "make serial_mapper", or "make
trace".  Please note that the library can be compiled either as serial
or as parallel. 'serial_mapper' is just a serial (non-MPI) version of
parallel_mapper, and trace is serial as well, so "make clean" between
parallel_mapper and serial_mapper/trace.
